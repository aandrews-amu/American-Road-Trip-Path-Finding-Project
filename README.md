# 50 States Project 

data.py 
- Strings of location data put into lists to be fed to algorithm 
- All data in proper format for GoogleMaps distance matrix API

distances.py 
- Code taken from Randal S. Olson "Computing the optimal road trip across the U.S."
- Uses data from data.py to call GoogleMaps distance matrix API and fetch distance and duration data between all combinations of data points 
- Outputs the from point, to point, distance, and duration to my-waypoints-dist-dur.tsv file to later be parsed by algorithm

test.py
- Test code from Randal S. Olson
- Won't be used once project is done
- To delete!

genetic.py 
- Genetic algorithm to implement
